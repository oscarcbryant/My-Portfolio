## Purpose

The goal of our assignment today is to create a webpage that showcases our web development projects.
It was important that we demonstrate through this webpage the skills we have learnt in html and css.
The skills we have aimed to highlight as part of this project include page display, flex, use of colors and enabling links help navigate across the page. 

## Challenges and takeaways

We learnt how important it is to use html elements cleanly and clearly. For example, using div as a seperator in the images section, made it easier for us to structure the images down the page. Without this, they were grouped together unnecessariy. 
We also started by exploring the absolute and relative positioning features, however it was learnt throughout the process that this was not the most effective way of achieving spacing and positioning on the page. Instead, we explored flex, flex wrap as display properties.
  We also faced challenges in having the images showing on the page, something I will need to troubleshoot further.

##Update Feb 2022
We had a second attempt at this homework assignment.
This time around, we applied more of the features we have learnt over the past few weeks.
We fixed up the images so they would display correctly.
We arranged the images in a line using flex. 
We deployed further <div>'s and used that to help build containers to target out styling. 
We explored other CSS components like :hover and coloring to improve the user interface. 
We added links through the images which will take users to my repo when clicked. 
The page is now responsive to resizing. 

A great exercise and a strong sign we are improving our css knowledge and application.
