# My-Portfolio

## Purpose

The goal of our assignment today is to create a webpage that showcases our web development projects.
It was important that we demonstrate through this webpage the skills we have learnt in html and css.
The skills we have aimed to highlight as part of this project include page display, flex, use of colors and enabling links help navigate across the page. 

## Challenges and takeaways

We learnt a great deal about the significant of ensuring the html elements are cleanly and clearly laid out. For example, using div as a seperator in the images section, made it easier for us to structure the images down the page. Without this, they were grouped together unnecessariy. 
We also started by exploring the absolute and relative positioning features, however it was learnt throughout the process that this was not the most effective way of achieving spacing and positioning on the page. Instead, we explored flex, flex wrap as display properties.
  We also faced challenges in having the images showing on the page, something I will need to troubleshoot further.
  

  
  ## Next Steps
  
  This is a working progress but we are excited to take it forward and continue to improve with further elements as we grow into our development.
